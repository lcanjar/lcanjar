## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a sales enablement program for Lenovo's global eCommerce business.  This is a new role that was borne out of necessity ... as Lenovo's eCommerce business becomes a key Omnichannel and digital route for Lenovo sales and customer engagement.  AI will be an important focus area to help build capabilities at scale--and with global consistentcy.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, GitLab, VC, ... and AI skills.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on areas associated with eCommerce technology, business processes, and generative AI projects to optimize commerce, customer experience, digital marketing/personalization, and reporting.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning Python and associated build/IDE tools.  I have been in management roles (technology and business) for the past 10+ years.  And am refreshing my skills by attending an AI bootcamp program.  I am a trained Java program and understand basic constructs, logic, and syntax.  Since it has been so long since I have done technical, hands-on work I welcome all the help I can get.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my international experience.  My family and I have lived and traveled abroad over the course of my career.  Having lived in Japan and England, with many short stops along the way.  I am a military retire and a Gulf War veteran.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I first started in software engineering in ... well, let's just say it was a long time ago.  I had the good fortune of working for the Air Force Weather Agency and helped (as part of a larger consulting+military software engineering team_) to migrate from a legacy, mainframe data ingest subsystem.  To a modern Java-based, distributed subsystem.  I learned from the best.  What a great experience.
